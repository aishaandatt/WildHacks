## Project Motivation and Overview
##### Our project is designed to help identify animals using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) classification and to serve as an alert system for people in their practices.<br></br>For eg, Farmers wanting to look after their crops, People living in bungalows looking to maintain their backyards,etc.

## Dataset
##### Our custom dataset consists of 91 classes with 5850 images.<br></br>No. of classes for animals:90<br></br> No. of classes of humans:1

## Model Description
### Adding Hidden layers<br></br>
##### We have added 5 hidden layers using "Relu" activation function and 1 Dense layer.<br></br>The output layer has "softmax" activation function.
